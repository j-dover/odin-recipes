    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      "You don't need a whole basket of vine-ripened tomatoes to make a delicious tomato bisque. 
      We're going to use canned tomatoes. Rice makes this soup silky, not starchy."<br>

      <li>1 cup diced onion </li>
      <li>&frac12; cup diced celery </li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
      <li>1 (32 ounce) container chicken broth, or more as needed</li>
      <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed San Marzano tomatoes</li>
      <li>&frac12; teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>1 pinch freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons uncooked jasmine rice</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon white sugar, or to taste</li>
      <li>&frac12; cup heavy whipping cream</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh basil leaves, divided</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion and celery with a pinch of salt until onion is translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. 
        Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour chicken broth and tomatoes into onion mixture. Bring to a simmer and season with paprika, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. 
        Turn heat to low and stir rice into soup; skim foam occasionally and simmer until rice and vegetables are very tender, 35 to 45 minutes. Add sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blend soup with an immersion blender in the pot until smooth. Whisk 1/2 cup cream into soup and adjust levels of salt, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and sugar. 
        If soup is too thick, add more broth; if soup is too thin, cook, stirring often, until reduced and slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. 
        Ladle into warmed bowls; garnish each bowl with a drizzle of cream and top with about 1 teaspoon chopped basil.
      </li>
